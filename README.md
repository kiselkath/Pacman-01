# (ಠᴗಠ) PacMan Game (ಠᴗಠ)

### Three Interesting Facts About Pac-Man

1. **Pac-Man’s design was inspired by a slice of pizza.**  
   Creator Toru Iwatani said the character’s iconic shape came from seeing a pizza with a missing slice — which led to the round, yellow hero we know today.

2. **Each ghost has its own unique AI personality.**  
   They don’t move randomly!
    - **Blinky (red):** Aggressive and directly chases Pac-Man.
    - **Pinky (pink):** Tries to ambush Pac-Man by aiming ahead of him.
    - **Inky (blue):** Uses a complex strategy based on both Blinky’s and Pac-Man’s positions.
    - **Clyde (orange):** Alternates between chasing Pac-Man and wandering off unpredictably.

3. **Pac-Man was designed to appeal to a broader audience.**  
   Unlike the shooter-style games dominating arcades in the late ’70s, Pac-Man was intentionally nonviolent, colorful, and easy to understand — helping it attract a much more diverse group of players.
